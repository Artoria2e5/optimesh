Several mesh smoothing/optimization methods with one simple interface. optimesh

 * is fast,
 * preserves submeshes,
 * only works for triangular meshes (for now), and
 * supports all mesh formats that [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) can
   handle.

Install with
```
pip install optimesh
```
Example call:
```
optimesh in.e out.vtk --method lloyd -n 50
```
Output:
![terminal-screenshot](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/term-screenshot.png)

The left hand-side graph shows the distribution of angles (the grid line is at the
optimal 60 degrees). The right hand-side graph shows the distribution of simplex
quality, where quality is twice the ratio of circumcircle and incircle radius.

All command-line options are viewed with
```
optimesh -h
```

#### Laplacian smoothing
![laplace](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/laplace.png)

Ordinary [Laplacian mesh smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_smoothing).
Fast, preserves the mesh density.
```
optimesh circle.vtk out.vtk --method laplace
```

#### ODT smoothing
![odt](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/odt.png)

Optimal Delaunay Triangulation (ODT) treated as a minimization problem.
Assumes a uniform mesh (for now), so it does _not_ preserve the original mesh density.

```
optimesh circle.vtk out.vtk --method odt
```

#### CVT/pseudo-Lloyd smoothing
![lloyd](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/lloyd.png)

Centroidal Voronoi tessellation smoothing, realized by [Lloyd's
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) adapted for triangular
meshes. If the topological neighbors of any node are also the geometrically closest
nodes, this is exactly Lloyd's algorithm. That is fulfilled in many practical cases, but
the algorithm can break down if it is not.

Assumes a uniform mesh (for now), so it does _not_ preserve the original mesh density.
```
optimesh circle.vtk out.vtk --method lloyd
```

#### Chen-Holst smoothing

Mesh optimization after [Chen and Holst](#relevant-publications). Both methods honor the
`-u`/`--uniform-density` command line option. If not given, the mesh density is
preserved.

* ODT-like smoothing

  ![ch-odt](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/ch-odt.png)
  ```
  optimesh circle.vtk out.vtk --method chen-odt --uniform-density
  ```

* CPT (Centroidal Patch Triangulation, CVT-like smoothing)

  ![ch-cpt](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/ch-cpt.png)
  ```
  optimesh circle.vtk out.vtk --method chen-cpt --uniform-density
  ```

### Access from Python

All optimesh functions can also be accessed from Python directly, for example:
```python
import optimesh

X, cells = optimesh.odt(X, cells, 1.0e-2, 100, verbosity=1)
```

### Installation

optimesh is [available from the Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/optimesh/), so simply do
```
pip install -U optimesh
```
to install or upgrade. Use `sudo -H` to install as root or the `--user` option
of `pip` to install in `$HOME`.
