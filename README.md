Several mesh smoothing/optimization methods with one simple interface. optimesh

 * is fast,
 * preserves submeshes,
 * only works for triangular meshes (for now), and
 * supports all mesh formats that [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) can
   handle.

Install with
```
pip install optimesh
```
Example call:
```
optimesh in.e out.vtk --method cvt-uniform-fp -n 50
```
Output:

The left hand-side graph shows the distribution of angles (the grid line is at the
optimal 60 degrees). The right hand-side graph shows the distribution of simplex
quality, where quality is twice the ratio of circumcircle and incircle radius.

All command-line options are viewed with
```
optimesh -h
```

#### CVT (centroidal Voronoi tesselation)

![cvt-uniform-fp](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/cvt-uniform-fp.webp) |
:--------------------------------------------:|
`--method cvt-uniform-fp` (Lloyd's algorithm) |

Centroidal Voronoi tessellation smoothing, realized by [Lloyd's
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm), i.e., points are
iteratively moved into the centroid of their Voronoi cell.  If the topological neighbors
of any node are also the geometrically closest nodes, this is exactly Lloyd's algorithm.
That is fulfilled in many practical cases, but the algorithm can break down if it is
not.


#### CPT (centroidal patch tessalation)

![cpt-uniform-fp](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/cpt-uniform-fp.webp) |
![cpt-uniform-qn](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/cpt-uniform-qn.webp) |
:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
density-preserving linear solve (Laplacian smoothing, `--method cpt-dp`) | uniform-density fixed-point iteration (`--method cpt-uniform-fp`) | uniform-density quasi-Newton (`--method cpt-uniform-qn`) |

A smooting method suggested by [Chen and Holst](#relevant-publications), mimicking CVT
but much more easily implemented. The density-preserving variant leads to the exact same
equation system as [Laplacian smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_smoothing).

The uniform-density variants are implemented classically as a fixed-point iteration and
as a quasi-Newton method. The latter typically converges faster.


#### ODT (optimal Delaunay tesselation)

![odt-dp-fp](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/odt-dp-fp.webp) |
![odt-uniform-fp](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/odt-uniform-fp.webp) |
![odt-uniform-no](https://nschloe.github.io/optimesh/odt-uniform-no.webp) |
:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|
density-preserving fixed-point iteration (`--method odt-dp-fp`) | uniform-density fixed-point iteration (`--method odt-uniform-fp`) | uniform-density nonlinear optimization (`--method odt-uniform-no`) |

Optimal Delaunay Triangulation (ODT) as suggested by [Chen and
Holst](#relevant-publications). Typically superior to CPT, but also more expensive to
compute.

Implemented once classically as a fixed-point iteration, once as a nonlinear
optimization method. The latter typically leads to better results.


### Which method is best?

From practical experiments, it seems that CVT smoothing gives very satisfactory results.
Here is a comparison of all uniform-density methods applied to the random circle mesh
seen above:

(Mesh quality is twice the ratio of incircle and circumcircle radius, with the maximum
being 1.)


### Access from Python

All optimesh functions can also be accessed from Python directly, for example:
```python
import optimesh

X, cells = optimesh.odt.fixed_point_uniform(X, cells, 1.0e-2, 100, verbosity=1)
```

### Installation

optimesh is [available from the Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/optimesh/), so simply do
```
pip install -U optimesh
```
to install or upgrade. Use `sudo -H` to install as root or the `--user` option
of `pip` to install in `$HOME`.
